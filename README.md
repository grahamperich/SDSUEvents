# SDSUEvents 
## About
[Live Site](http://www.sdsuevents.com/)
Please allow a moment for the site to load. It is deployed on Heroku and can take up to 30 seconds to spin up because of Heroku's limitations for free applications.

This is an event discovery and curation tool for SDSU students. It was never formally launched on the SDSU campus because of administrative concerns and copyright/trademark issues. SDSUEvents is hosted on [Heroku](www.heroku.com) using PostgreSQL for the production database.
