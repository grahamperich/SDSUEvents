## About
[Live Site](http://www.sdsuevents.com/)
This is an event discovery and curation tool for SDSU students. It was never formally launched on the SDSU campus because of administrative concerns and copyright/trademark issues. SDSUEvents is hosted on [Heroku](www.heroku.com) using PostgreSQL for the production database.
